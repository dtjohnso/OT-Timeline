A Timeline of OT History
========================

This project is currently a work in progress.

## Todo

* Finish merging local data file with information contained in Google Spreadsheet
* Fix bugs with presentation of date information in lens
* Separate events into separate data files by eventType for easier recycling into future projects (e.g. separate files for Israel and non-Israel events)
* Add events that show span of major periods in Israel's history (Exodus, Conquest, Egyptian sojourn, etc).
* Add events to show the span of major dynasties (Omride dynasty, etc)
* Add dates for events in David (based on info from Merrill)
* Add information about OT prophets
* Add information about rulers of Egypt, Assyria, & Babylon who significantly impact the flow of OT history
* Confirm dates from Isaiah source data file against dates in Thiele.
* Generalize timeline code into a separate repo, add that repo as an upstream remote for easier development of features for timelines generally

## Sources

These dates are based on a number of different sources, which I've tried to recognize in the "source" field for each data point. I have used some sources more than others in confirming these dates, and these are listed below:

Thiele, Edwin Richard. *The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings.* Grand Rapids, MI: Kregel, 1994.

Merrill, Eugene H. *Kingdom of Priests: A History of Old Testament Israel.* Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Books, 1996.
